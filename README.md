The main purpose of the project is to make the seeker (robot) controlled by a Bluetooth module, detect humidity, temperature, flame,
and gas leaks using sensors and save the data to the thingspeak database, hosting APIs and retrieving JSON data with NodeJS on a table 
that is designed in the frontend part on the home section. A login page was designed to make sure that each client possesses their own 
robot and is the only owner. The accounts data are written in JavaScript code and are saved in the local Storage( inspect application),
and are retrieved on the login page (inspectconsole). As well in the materials part are mentioned some tools that have been used to
build the robot with some definition and styling using CSS. Finally, the about is the introduction and contact part where our customers 
can send us emails in case of a malfunction as well as feedback and follow our Instagram account to keep in touch.
